# Hi 👋, I’m Foram

## 🧠 About Me
I’m a **Computer Science student** who’s done with surface-level learning.

My focus is on:
- 🧩 **Data Structures & Algorithms** (because fundamentals decide who survives interviews)
- ⚙️ **Backend & System-Oriented Development**
- 🤖 **AI-integrated applications** (AI as a tool, not a buzzword)

I like understanding **how things actually work** — not just using libraries blindly.

## 🎯 What I’m Currently Working On
- Building **DSA consistency** 
- Backend projects with **clean architecture & APIs**
- Learning how to **blend AI into real products**
